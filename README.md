# BlazorResearchAndDev

This is the research and development project for adding a custom controls for datagrid in blazorise and custom changes for blazorise components.
This includes ASP.NET Core 6 and Blazorise 1.0.6.

Blazorise v0.9.5 was missing a functionality of closing the child datagrid inside a datagrid while clicking,
these changes leverage the functionality to close the grid on clicking it again. 

There are few controls that has been customised, inside counter.razor web page, changes are done for handling the data grid for DetailRowGridEvent.
This projects also includes setting of projects for ASP.NET core 6.0 and setting up environment for Microsoft Blazor.
This project includes Object oriented programming skills, SOLID principles, singleton design pattern and repository design pattern.


Upcoming changes:

- This project will contain proof of concepts for state design patterns and abstract factory pattern.
- This will also include some custom blazorise components
- I am looking forward for creating a library from which we can easily customize the choose file button.
